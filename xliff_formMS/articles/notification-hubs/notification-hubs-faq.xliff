          <source>Azure Notification Hubs is able to process atleast 1 million sends in 1 minute in a normal use scenario where the incoming load is pretty consistent and isn't spikey in nature. This rate may vary depending on the number of tags, nature of incoming sends etc. In this duration we are able to calculate the targets per platform and route messages to the respective push notification services based on the registered tags/tag expressions. From here on, it is the responsibility of the Push Notifications services (PNS) to send the notification to the device. PNSs do not guarantee any SLA for delivering notifications however typically a vast majority of messages are delivered to the devices within a few minutes (&lt; 10 minute) from the time they are sent to our platform. There may be a few outliers which may take more time. Azure Notification Hubs also has a policy in place to drop any notifications which aren't able to be delivered to the PNS in 30 minutes. This delay can happen for a number of reasons, most commonly because the PNS is throttling your application.</source>
